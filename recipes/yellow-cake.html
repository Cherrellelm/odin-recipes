<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Semi-sweet chocolate</li>
    <li>Butter milk</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Powdered sugar</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Corn starch</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Baking powder</li>
    <li>Cocoa powder</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350F. Sift the flour, corn starch, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl then whisk together and set aside.</li>
    <li>Mix butter and sugar in a stand mixer using a paddle attachment. Once the mixture light and fluffy pour in the oil and vanilla then mix until combined.  Add the eggs and yolks one at a time while mixing on medium-low then scrape the bowl down. </li>
    <li>Add the flour mixture into the mixer in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk. Mix until just combined then give that bowl one last scrape down. Distribute batter evenly into the three prepared cake pans and bake for about 30 minutes at 350F.</li>
    <li>Allow the layers to rest in the pans for a minute then invert onto a wire rack and allow to cool completely. </li>
    <li>While the cake layers are cooling you can whip up the delicious chocolate buttercream. In a small bowl melt the semi-sweet chocolate with 1/4 cup milk, 30 seconds in the microwave should be enough but you can give it a bit more time if needed. In another small bowl mix the cocoa powder with 1/4 cup of melted butter.</li>
    <li>Cream the butter then pour in the cocoa powder/butter mixture and mix until combined. Scrape the bowl down and mix once more.</li>
    <li>Add the salt and powdered sugar then mix until incorporated. Beat in the ganache then add milk a tablespoon at a time until the consistency is silky smooth. </li>
    <li>Pipe buttercream onto the first layer then add the next layer on and repeat the process until the cake is built. Cover the cake with buttercream then use a spatula to smooth and create a rustic swoopy effect.</li>
</ol>
